# SwiftCodeKata
Learn Swift by solving small problems

## Purpose
The aim of the list is to help us become better programmers by solving small problems that are either encoutered a lot in the day to day practice or they have some interesting twist

## How to use the list
- Pick a random problem
- Open a brand new Swift Playground
- Solve the problem without using the Internet or any other documentation (maybe except the IDE autocomplete)
- If the above is not possible, use any documentation available, but make a note to return and try again in the future

## Problems to solve

### Date

- Format a date: Display the current date in the following format: `9:30am / July 20, 2020`

- Extract a date from a string: Convert a date in the format `9:30am / July 20, 2020` into a Date object
